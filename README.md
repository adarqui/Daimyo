This repo is for my polyglot obsession. My progression through polyglot programming will be tracked here.

It will contain lots of different tests/algos/datastructures/code challenges in various programming languages. Basically, a training grounds of sorts.

The Haskell folder is the most organized. The other folders are a mish mash.
