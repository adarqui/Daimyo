E2. Suppose the positive integer n is odd. First Al writes the numbers 1, 2,..., 2n
on the blackboard. Then he picks any two numbers a, b, erases them, and writes,
instead, |a âˆ’ b|. Prove that an odd number will remain at the end.

solution n
    | n >= 1 && odd n = abs $ 1 - 2*n
    | otherwise = error "n must be >= 1 and odd"

    Still need to prove this mathematically.. hehe.. see above perhaps?
