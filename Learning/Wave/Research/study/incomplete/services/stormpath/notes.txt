By defining a postRegistrationHandler you’re able to do stuff like:

Send a new user a welcome email.
Generate API keys for all new users.
Setup Stripe billing.
etc.

Instead of defining a database table for users, and another database table for user profile information – with Stormpath, you don’t need either!

With Stormpath, however, this process is greatly simplified. Stormpath can create API keys for your users, store them securely, and completely handle API authentication / caching.
