Here’s a decision tree to know how the type you’re looking for is called:

Does your function return void? It’s called a Consumer
Does your function return boolean? It’s called a Predicate
Does your function return an int, long, double? It’s calledXXToIntYY, XXToLongYY, XXToDoubleYY something
Does your function take no arguments? It’s called a Supplier
Does your function take a single int, long, double argument? It’s called an IntXX, LongXX, DoubleXX something
Does your function take two arguments? It’s called BiXX
Does your function take two arguments of the same type? It’s calledBinaryOperator
Does your function return the same type as it takes as a single argument? It’s called UnaryOperator
Does your function take two arguments of which the first is a reference type and the second is a primitive type? It’s called ObjXXConsumer(only consumers exist with that configuration)
Else: It’s called Function
