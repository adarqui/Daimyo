CMake advantages over GNU Build System:

The language used to write CMakeLists.txt files is readable and easier to understand.
It doesn’t only rely on “Make” to build the project.
It supports multiple generators like Xcode, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.


When comparing CMake with Make, there are several advantages of using CMake:

Cross platform discovery of system libraries.
Automatic discovery and configuration of the toolchain.
Easier to compile your files into a shared library in a platform agnostic way, and in general easier to use than make.
