mongodb encourages denormalization and using a limited number of collections

A database cursor is a control structure that enables traversal over the records in a database.

More specifically, in MongoDB (and by extension, in Meteor apps) a cursor is a pointer to the result set of a Collection.find() query.

reactivity means different things on the client and server

on the server, meteor's reactivity is limited to cursors returned by Meteor.publish()
