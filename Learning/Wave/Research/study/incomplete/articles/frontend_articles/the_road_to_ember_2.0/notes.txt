"Our goal is that you can move your Ember app to 2.0 incrementally, one sprint at a time."

The Ember community works hard to introduce new ideas with an eye towards migration. We call this "stability without stagnation", and it's one of the cornerstones of the Ember philosophy.

In 2014, we made big bets in two areas, and they've paid off.

The first bet was on open standards: JavaScript modules, promises and Web Components. We started the year off with globals-based apps, callbacks and "views", and incrementally (and compatibly) built towards standards-based solutions as those standards solidified.

The second bet was that the community was as tired as we were of hand-rolling their own build scripts for each project. We've invested heavily in Ember CLI, giving us a single tool that unifies the community and provides a venue for disseminating great ideas.
