naive definition:
    program: A program is something that transforms input to outputs.
    programmer: A programmer is the person who writes the program, and programming is the act of writing this program.

better definition:
    program: A program is something that transforms inputs to outputs, subject to the following constraints:
        The output of the program is beautiful.
        The input to the program is beautiful.
        The program is beautiful.
        The input to the program is well and correctly documented.
        The program itself is well and correctly documented.
        The program is well tested and proved correct.
        The problem being solved is well specified.
        The problem is well specified.


There are three other things that make programming difficult:

    Fixing things that should not be broken
    No time for learning things
    Bad environment for programming
    Let’s look at these things - these are all “time thieves”

nice quote:
This problem is, by the way, the thing that takes most of my time, 60-70% of my time at a guess. I once spent over a week trying to get a broken LDAP server to work - my boss had forbidden me to implement my own LDAP server - but after a week of struggling with a broken LDAP sever written in C and badly documented I had a lapse of memory and forget that my boss said and accidentally implemented a server from scratch in Erlang during my lunch break.

hah:
I asked my boss if he wanted “nice slides” for the next presentation, he said yes, provided I got them to him before tomorrow.

haha: I'd like to rename this article as "Why having a job sucks".
