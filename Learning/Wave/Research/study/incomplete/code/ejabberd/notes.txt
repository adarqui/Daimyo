For storing persistent data, ejabberd uses Mnesia (the distributed internal Erlang database), but you can opt for other storage:

If deployed on a 16 GB RAM machine with at least 4 cores, a single ejabberd node can typically handle 200-300 K online users. This setup is suitable for systems with up to 10 nodes.

As such, ejabberd support:

Jingle, XMPP based voice protocol
SIP (Session Initiation Protocol): Yes, you can pass SIP calls using ejabberd :)
ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment: A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal)
STUN
TURN
Proxy65 media relay
This makes ejabberd the best XMPP server to support SIP and WebRTC based communication tools.
