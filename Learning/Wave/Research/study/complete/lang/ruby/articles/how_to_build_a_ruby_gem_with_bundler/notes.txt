guiding steps to TDD: red, green, refactor
- aka tight feedback loop

TDD fundamentally breaks down as the following:
- Write a test.
- Run the test and watch it fail (because there is no code yet for it to pass).
- Write the least amount of code to pass the test (literally, hack it together).
- Refactor the code so that itâ€™s cleaner and better written.
- If the test has failed through refactoring, then start the red, green, refactoring process again.

RSpec:
RSpec is a testing tool for the Ruby programming language. Born under the banner of behaviour-driven development, it is designed to make test-driven development a productive and enjoyable experience

in Rakefile: require 'rspec/core/rake_task':
- adds rspec related modules and classes for us to use
