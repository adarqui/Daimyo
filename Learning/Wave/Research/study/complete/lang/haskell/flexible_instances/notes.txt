allows you to use kind * and kind *->* in instance definitions?

-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}

class Something a where
  doSomething :: a -> Integer

instance Something Integer where
  doSomething x = 1

instance Something Char where
  doSomething x = 2

instance Something [Char] where
  doSomething x = 3
