class Observable obs val | obs -> val where
   getValue     :: obs -> IO val
   setValue     :: obs -> val -> IO ()
   getObservers :: obs -> IO [val -> IO ()]
   addObserver  :: obs -> (val -> IO ()) -> IO ()

- multi-param type class
- obs: observable object
- val: value the observable is carrying
- the functional dependency (obs -> val), states that the type of an observable uniquely determines the type of the value it is carrying

control:
- instance of Observable
- consists of a model (pointer to current value) and a pointer to a list of callbacks
- callbacks called if value changes
