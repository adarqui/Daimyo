**Wave Exercises**

**Set Theory**
- "find the indicated intersection, union, difference, etc if possible" of randomly generated sets
- "express the following sets of numbers using interval notation" , "write the set using interval notation" of randomly generated set notations
- "use the blank venn diagram for A, B, C ... shade in the following sets" of randomly generated sets and operations among them

**Algebra**
- Algebraic data structures for logarithms and base/exponents, and instances of classes to add/mul/div/etc.
- "simplify" : fractions, order of operations, based on various laws of arithmetic. Should be able to show which law at each step: distribute the negative, equivalent fractions, multiplication of fractions, addition and subtraction of fractions etc.
- "matrix generation" : generate matrices
- "matrix operations" : generate matrics and then generate operations on matrices

**Abstract Algebra**
+ Binomial coefficients function: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/AbstractAlgebra/Polynomial.hs
+ Pascal triangle data: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/AbstractAlgebra/Polynomial.hs

**Calculus**
+ Experiment with limits: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/Calculus/Exercises.hs

**Combinatorics**
- Random data to form graph structures
- Puzzle: How many regions of N intersecting lines form (with no points of the lines intersecting twice).
- Use cases of permutations & combinations

**Concrete Mathematics**
- Recurrence examples
- Generate normal form from various patterns of data

**Number Theory**
+ Primes, Prime sieve, Primes trial by division, Composites, Prime Factors: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/NumberTheory/Prime.hs
+ GCD: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/NumberTheory/GCD.hs
- Express the fundamental axiom of mathematrics (every positive integer is a product of two primes): https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/NumberTheory/TheoremOfMathematics.hs

**Geometry**
- Express propositions/axioms from C1
- Generate diagrams of triangles using sage/haskell

**Topology**
- Define a metric space

**Linear Algebra**
- Identify various fields

**Statistics**
+ Collecting data via /dev/<...>: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/Random.hs
- Generating statistics on random data/strings/etc (sample, mean, variance, correlation stddev etc)

**Group Theory**
- Caylay tables for multiplicative/additive groups: https://github.com/adarqui/Daimyo/blob/master/Haskell/src/Daimyo/GroupTheory/Tables.hs
- Examples of semigroups
- Examples of monoids
- Examples of p-groups
- Examples of albelian groups

**Translation**
- Number Theory Using Sage. This would be a great book to translate from sage to haskell.

**Pearls**
- "tell" version of SmallestFreeInteger: list, array, divide & conquer,
