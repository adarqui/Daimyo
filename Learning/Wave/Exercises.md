**Wave Exercises**

**Algebra**
- Algebraic data structures for logarithms and base/exponents, and instances of classes to add/mul/div/etc.

**Abstract Algebra**
+ Binomial coefficients function
+ Pascal triangle data

**Combinatorics**
- Random data to form graph structures
- Puzzle: How many regions of N intersecting lines form (with no points of the lines intersecting twice).
- Use cases of permutations & combinations

**Concrete Mathematics**
- Recurrence examples
- Generate normal form from various patterns of data

**Number Theory**
+ gcd, Primes, Prime sieve, Primes trial by division, Composites
- Prime factors
- Express the fundamental axiom of mathematrics (every positive integer is a product of two primes) 

**Geometry**
- Express propositions/axioms from C1
- Generate diagrams of triangles using sage/haskell

**Topology**
