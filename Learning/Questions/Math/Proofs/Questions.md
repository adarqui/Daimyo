Use the techniques of exploration to investigate each of the following statements.
Can you make a conjecture as to whether the statement is true or false? Can you
determine whether it is true or false?

1. (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 , for all real numbers a and b.
2. There are integers x and y such that 2x + 5y = 41.
3. If x is an even integer, then x^2 is an even integer.
4. If x and y are odd integers, then x * y is an odd integer.

Definition. An integer a is an even integer provided that there exists an
integer n such that a = 2n. An integer a is an odd integer provided there
exists an integer n such that a = 2n + 1.
