If you're reading this.. you'll think I want to read/understand "all" of the resources listed. Well, actually, I would. However, my goal is to start with texts that will make me a better programmer; so i'll focus mostly on the logic, proofs, type theory, discrete math, lambda calculus, data structures & algorithms, puzzles, crypto, complexity, automata, matrix, set, and category theory.

I'm reviving this project as of July 2015. I took a long vacation from it because I simply couldn't focus on it while working, not enough time/too tired.
